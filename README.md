# CSV & OpenAI Integration

A Streamlit-based application for comprehensive data analysis, cleaning, visualization, and modeling with OpenAI integration.

## Overview

This application provides an intuitive interface for data scientists and analysts to work with CSV data files. It leverages OpenAI's API to generate intelligent insights, cleaning suggestions, and visualizations based on the data content.

Key features:
- ðŸ“Š Intelligent data analysis with OpenAI integration
- ðŸ§¹ Smart data cleaning with automated code generation
- ðŸ“ˆ Advanced data visualization with customizable options
- ðŸ¤– Machine learning model building and evaluation
- ðŸ“‘ Export capabilities for reports and findings

## Requirements

This application requires Python 3.8+ and the following libraries:

```
streamlit
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
python-dotenv
openai
reportlab
markdown
beautifulsoup4
numpy
altair
scikit-learn
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/csv-openai-integration.git
   cd csv-openai-integration
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. The application will open in your default web browser.

3. Upload a CSV file using the file uploader.

4. Navigate through the different tabs to:
   - Preview and understand your data
   - Clean and preprocess your data
   - Generate visualizations and insights
   - Build and evaluate machine learning models
